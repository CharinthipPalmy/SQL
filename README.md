- The two most important customers of the firm may have been hacked. Verify if there are any fraudulent transactions in their history. For privacy reasons, you only know that their cardholder IDs are 2 and 18.

- Using hvPlot, create a line plot representing the time series of transactions over the course of the year for each cardholder separately.

- Next, to better compare their patterns, create a single line plot that containing both card holders' trend data.

- What difference do you observe between the consumption patterns? Does the difference suggest a fraudulent transaction? Explain your rationale in the markdown report.

## Question 1 conclusion

Using hvPlot, create a box plot, representing the expenditure data from January 2018 to June 2018 for cardholder ID 25.

Are there any outliers for cardholder ID 25? How many outliers are there per month?

Do you notice any anomalies? Describe your observations and conclusions in your markdown report.
